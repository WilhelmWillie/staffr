# staffr

Staffr is a basic employee directory that allows managers to maintain a list of current employees. 

Staffr is an example project built with SailsJS and Angular 2. Staffr was built with the intention of getting comfortable with Angular 2 to interface with a REST API. SailsJS was used to quickly whip up a REST API using its models and Blueprint API feature.

As a student software engineer for USC ITS, I was instructed to look into Angular 2 and Sails.js, hence why Staffr was created.
